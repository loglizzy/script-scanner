# script-scanner
devs secured the remotes? No problems, use that boi and find the source of any shit

# how to use
1. Add some keywords (example: 'magnitude', 'Kick', 'Health')
2. Select the threads amount (how many scripts gonna be checked by once, i recommend using 15)
3. Start then the results gonna show up in the "Results" section, you can click on them to copy to the clipboard

*. Progress can be see in the console (F9)

# todo
- [x] Run in threads synchronously
- [x] Fix stop button
- [x] Fix copy path
- [x] Cant edit threads amount while scanning
- [x] Cant remove/add keywords while scanning
- [x] Simplify path in results (game.Workspace.randomshit -> Workspace.randomshit)
- [x] Apply "game" to copy path (Players.LocalPlayer -> game.Players.LocalPlayer)
- [x] Ignore duplicated scripts, using data cost check (huge improvement)
- [x] Add progress bar & counter
- [ ] Probly change the progress bar position, to the "Results" label right side
