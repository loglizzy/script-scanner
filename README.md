# script-scanner
devs secured the remotes? No problems, use that boi and find the source of any shit

# how to use
1. Add some keywords (example: 'magnitude', 'Kick', 'Health')
2. Select the threads amount (how many scripts gonna be checked by once, i recommend using 15)
3. Start then the results gonna show up in the "Results" section, you can click on them to copy to the clipboard

*. Progress can be see in the console (F9)
